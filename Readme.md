# Tebex Package Checker for Discord

This is a simple bot to check if a user has an active package older than 30 days. I created it for my personal needs, but feel free to use and modify it as you see fit.

### Getting your Tebex API Key:

1. Visit [Tebex Game Servers](https://creator.tebex.io/game-servers).
2. Create a game server using the plugin.
3. Name the server whatever you want
4. Once you have the API key, you're good to go.

### Installation and Running the Bot:

- Install the necessary dependencies like with any other Discord bot.
- I recommend using PM2 for running the bot.
